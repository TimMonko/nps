# Join the Napari Plugin Sustainability Initiative

## 🌟 Strengthen the Future of Scientific Image Analysis

The napari plugin ecosystem has grown to over **500 community-contributed plugins**, powering cutting-edge research in microscopy, medical imaging, and beyond. But with great growth comes great responsibility – many plugins need ongoing maintenance, updates, and community support to remain viable for the scientific community.

**We need your help to ensure these valuable tools remain accessible and reliable for researchers worldwide.**
